## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Optional `recommendation_options` field on finding entries

The system SHALL emit findings whose `recommendation` is genuinely disjunctive — offering the user a choice between two or more concrete alternatives — with an additional optional structured field `recommendation_options: [{label, body}]` alongside the existing prose `recommendation` field. This field exists as a producer-side affordance for the address-reviews consumer's structured decision-fork detection path (per `orbit-address-reviews` `Disjunctive recommendation fields surface as decision forks`).

**Field shape** (when present on a finding entry):

```
recommendation_options: [
  { "label": "A", "body": "<concrete option 1 text>" },
  { "label": "B", "body": "<concrete option 2 text>" },
  ...
]
```

- `label`: short identifier (typically `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, …, or `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`, …).
- `body`: the concrete option text (the action the user would take if they pick this option).
- Array MUST contain ≥ 2 entries when present (single-option arrays defeat the purpose; the regular `recommendation` field carries single recommendations).

**When to emit** (normative — applies to all 9 proposal-mode passes + 7 system-mode passes; pass-specific behavior is enumerated in scenarios below where helpful):

- Emit `recommendation_options` when the finding's recommendation genuinely requires a choice — multiple defensible paths, each producing a different outcome (e.g., "file a follow-up issue" vs. "extend the current change's scope").
- Do NOT emit `recommendation_options` for findings with a single concrete action ("rename X to Y", "remove the duplicate scenario") — those use the prose `recommendation` field alone.
- The prose `recommendation` field SHALL still summarize the disjunction for readers of the markdown report (e.g., "Either (A) file a follow-up issue, or (B) extend scope to tasks.md"). The structured field complements the prose; it does not replace it.

**Backward compatibility**: the `recommendation_options` field is OPTIONAL on every finding. Findings without disjunctive recommendations omit it. Existing parsers that don't recognize the field SHALL ignore it (forward-compatible by design).

#### Scenario: Disjunctive finding emits both recommendation prose and structured options

- **WHEN** a proposal-mode pass identifies a finding where the recommendation is "Either file a follow-up issue tracking the v2 polish work, OR add Group 19 to tasks.md extending this change's scope to cover the missing scenarios"
- **THEN** the finding's JSON entry contains both: (a) `recommendation`: the prose summary string with "Either … or …" phrasing; (b) `recommendation_options`: `[{label: "A", body: "file a follow-up issue tracking the v2 polish work"}, {label: "B", body: "add Group 19 to tasks.md extending this change's scope to cover the missing scenarios"}]`

#### Scenario: Single-recommendation finding omits structured options

- **WHEN** a system-mode pass identifies a finding whose recommendation is a single concrete action (e.g., "Rename `ReviewMode` to `ReviewModeConfig` consistently across all callers")
- **THEN** the finding's JSON entry contains the prose `recommendation` field but does NOT include `recommendation_options`

#### Scenario: Three-way option fork emitted with three entries

- **WHEN** a pass identifies a finding offering three distinct paths (e.g., "(A) rewrite the assertion, (B) skip the test, (C) file an issue and document the skip rationale")
- **THEN** the `recommendation_options` array contains three entries with labels "A", "B", "C" and the corresponding option bodies

#### Scenario: Address-reviews structured-path detection uses recommendation_options

- **WHEN** address-reviews ingests a `review-<mode>-<TS>.json` produced by this command and one of its findings includes `recommendation_options`
- **THEN** address-reviews surfaces the structured options directly (without re-parsing the prose `recommendation` field via heuristic), per `orbit-address-reviews` `Disjunctive recommendation fields surface as decision forks`

#### Scenario: Field is forward-compatible — old parsers ignore it cleanly

- **WHEN** a downstream parser (e.g., a hypothetical older `address-reviews` or `orbit-status`) reads a review JSON containing `recommendation_options`
- **THEN** the parser MUST treat the field as ignorable (parsers SHOULD NOT fail on unknown fields per JSON forward-compat conventions); the parser's behavior on the finding's other fields is unchanged

#### Scenario: Producer-side enforcement — minimum 2 entries when field is present

- **WHEN** an editorial pass would emit a finding with `recommendation_options` containing fewer than 2 entries (zero or one)
- **THEN** the producer SHALL EITHER (a) omit the field entirely (preferred — single-recommendation findings use the prose `recommendation` field alone) OR (b) refuse to emit and surface a writer-side warning. Producing a JSON with a 0- or 1-entry `recommendation_options` array is a producer bug; downstream consumers handle it via fallback (per `orbit-address-reviews` `Disjunctive recommendation fields surface as decision forks` malformed-array scenario), but emit-time should not produce such arrays in the first place.

#### Scenario: Producer-side enforcement — every entry has required label and body fields

- **WHEN** an editorial pass would emit a finding with `recommendation_options` where any entry is missing the required `label` or `body` field, or either field is an empty string
- **THEN** the producer SHALL EITHER (a) populate the missing/empty field with a meaningful value OR (b) drop the malformed entry (re-check the ≥ 2-entry rule afterward) OR (c) refuse to emit. The structured field's contract is "every entry has non-empty label AND non-empty body"; emitting malformed entries is a producer bug.
